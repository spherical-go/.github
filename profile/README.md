Spherical Go transforms the ancient Go game of strategy and encirclement to a spherical playing field, challenging players to think in new dimensions.

## We Embrace Open Culture
* Open Development: We develop and maintain [standard game concepts and playing rules](https://github.com/spherical-go/spherical-go) through an open process, inviting the community to contribute and share their insights.
* Open Source Software: Our project, [PolyClash](https://github.com/spherical-go/polyclash), serves as a reference implementation of Spherical Go, fully open for anyone to use, learn from, and contribute to.
